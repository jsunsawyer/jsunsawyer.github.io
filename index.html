        I find it poetic that my ex-wife hated bad poetry<br>
        & cheated on me with a man who writes bad poetry
      </h1>
      <h2>By <span>Anis Mojgani</span>, from the book “<span>In the Pockets of Small Gods</span>”</h2>

      <p>
        We had taken Zepplin out to the nearby baseball field<br>
        so he could chase birds to his heart's content.<br>
        We had spent the night moving our two skins into one<br>
        until the sun rose and then went to the nearby diner<br>
        patroned by old men and served by old women to eat eggs and toast and<br>
        then under the early morning gray light<br>
        walked back to the house at the top of the curving hill<br>
        and fucked again before falling asleep<br>
        and then waking in the late afternoon to take the dog for a walk.

        Beside the diamond was an electric box covered in bees,<br>
        all of them consumed with the hum of the metal,<br>
        loving its surface with their bodies.<br>
        While Zepp wandered the scents through the forest<br>
        we took turns practicing jump rope with his leash,<br>
        excavated our hearts to share silly walks with one another,<br>
        made up songs on the spot, unafraid to look wrong to the other.<br>
        When Zepp came bounding out of the trees<br>
        literally tumbling down the hill<br>
        a scream in the air coming from out the bunny in his jaws<br>
        we grabbed him by the scruff of his neck<br>
        made him drop it but didn't know what to do<br>
        with the rabbit's dying but not yet dead young and torn body.<br>
        Neither of us could start our morning with killing something<br>
        so we leashed the dog and leaving it behind us, walked for home<br>
        our hearts shaking, holding each other's hand.

        Years later, one of her affairs was with a man who knows how to quarter a<br>
        deer. He was neither the first nor the only.<br>
        But he knew how to put up a wall and take apart<br>
        the engine of a motorcycle. Knew how to play the piano.<br>
        He who was married to my wife's closest friend in lexas.<br>
        He who that summer would sit down across the table<br>
        time and time again to share brisket with me.<br>
        He who visited her in my hometown, stayed<br>
        less than two miles from my parents, slept with her<br>
        in the same house that she and I had slept in years prior
      </p>

      <p>
        the night before we flew off to our honeymoon. Who<br>
        when he left his wife for mine<br>
        took their copies of my books with him.
      </p>

      <p>
        He knew how to shoot and how to cut the throat<br>
        of a quivering animal, skin it once dead,<br>
        and who if needed to<br>
        could probably pull a rabbit<br>
        out of a hound dog's mouth<br>
        and for the rabbit's own good<br>
        step down on its wet neck. Something<br>
        neither I nor her<br>
        were able to do.
