            I find it poetic that my ex-wife hated bad poetry<br>
            & cheated on me with a man who writes bad poetry
          </h1>
          <h2>By <span>Anis Mojgani</span>, from the book “<span>In the Pockets of Small Gods</span>”</h2>
        </div>
        
        <p>
          <span class="highlight--blue h-1">We had taken Zepplin out to the nearby baseball field<br>
          so he could chase birds to his heart's content.</span><br>
          <span class="highlight--blue h-2">We had spent the night moving our two skins into one<br>
          until the sun rose and then went to the nearby diner<br>
          patroned by old men and served by old women to eat eggs and toast and</span><br>
          <span class="highlight--red h-3">then under the early morning gray light<br>
          walked back to the house at the top of the curving hill<br>
          and fucked again before falling asleep<br>
          and then waking in the late afternoon to take the dog for a walk.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="highlight--red h-4">Beside the diamond was an electric box covered in bees,<br>
          all of them consumed with the hum of the metal,<br>
          loving its surface with their bodies.</span><br>
          <span class="highlight--blue h-5">While Zepp wandered the scents through the forest<br>
          we took turns practicing jump rope with his leash,</span><br>
          <span class="highlight--blue h-6">excavated our hearts to share silly walks with one another,<br>
          made up songs on the spot, unafraid to look wrong to the other.</span><br>
          <span class="highlight--red h-7">When Zepp came bounding out of the trees<br>
          literally tumbling down the hill<br>
          a scream in the air coming from out the bunny in his jaws<br>
          we grabbed him by the scruff of his neck<br>
          made him drop it but didn't know what to do<br>
          with the rabbit's dying but not yet dead young and torn body.</span><br>
          <span class="highlight--red h-7--2">Neither of us could start our morning with killing something<br>
          so we leashed the dog and leaving it behind us, walked for home<br>
          our hearts shaking, holding each other's hand.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="highlight--blue h-8">Years later, one of her affairs was with a man who knows how to quarter a<br>
          deer. He was neither the first nor the only.</span><br>
          <span class="highlight--blue h-9">But he knew how to put up a wall and take apart<br>
          the engine of a motorcycle.</span> <span class="highlight--blue h-10">Knew how to play the piano.<br>
          He who was married to my wife's closest friend in Texas.</span><br>
          <span class="highlight--blue h-11">He who that summer would sit down across the table<br>
          time and time again to share brisket with me.</span><br>
          <span class="highlight--red h-12">He who visited her in my hometown, stayed<br>
          less than two miles from my parents, slept with her<br>
          in the same house that she and I had slept in years prior<br>
          the night before we flew off to our honeymoon.</span> <span class="highlight--red h-13">Who<br>
          when he left his wife for mine<br>
          took their copies of my books with him.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="highlight--red h-14">He knew how to shoot and how to cut the throat<br>
          of a quivering animal, skin it once dead,</span><br>
          <span class="highlight--blue h-15">and who if needed to<br>
          could probably pull a rabbit<br>
          out of a hound dog's mouth</span><br>
          <span class="highlight--red h-16">and for the rabbit's own good<br>
          step down on its wet neck.</span> <span class="highlight--blue h-17">Something<br>
          neither I nor her<br>
          were able to do.</span>
